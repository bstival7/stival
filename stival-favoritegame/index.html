								<h3>Joel</h3>
							</header>
							<p>A brutal survivor with few moral lines left to cross. Joel, now in his late 40s, has been hardened by the ravages of the fungal pandemic that has devastated civilization as we know it. He's lost friends, family, and everything he valued in life. Living in one of few remaining military-controlled quarantine zones, he operates as a black market smuggler, dealing in contraband, taking numerous de-humanizing jobs over the years to survive in this new post-pandemic world. Joel's conscience slowly dwindles away as he shuts down his emotions to cope to his new life.</p>

								<h3>Ellie</h3>
							</header>
							<p>A brave, 14 year old girl, Ellie has grown up in this harsh world and it is all she has ever known. She's an orphan who was raised in a boarding school run by the military within the bounds of the quarantine zone. Naive and curious about the outside world, she is wise beyond her years and highly capable of taking care of herself and those around her. Obsessed with comic books, CDs, and other pop culture, her knowledge base is filled by the remnants of a world that no longer exists.</p>
